# Wind Production Forecasting

This repository contains code for a research project on wind energy production forecasting using a hybrid methodology of statistical models and deep learning techniques.

## Overview

Accurate forecasting of wind energy production is critical for integrating renewable energy sources into the power grid. This project explores the use of traditional statistical models (ARIMA, SARIMA, ARIMAX, SARIMAX) and advanced deep learning models (CNN, LSTM, TCN, CNN-LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM) to predict wind power generation based on historical data.
