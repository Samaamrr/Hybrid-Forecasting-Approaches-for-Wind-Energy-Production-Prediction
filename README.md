# Wind Production Forecasting

This repository contains code for a research project on wind energy production forecasting using a hybrid methodology of statistical models and deep learning techniques.

## Overview

Accurate forecasting of wind energy production is critical for integrating renewable energy sources into the power grid. This project explores the use of traditional statistical models (ARIMA, SARIMA, ARIMAX, SARIMAX) and advanced deep learning models (CNN, LSTM, TCN, CNN-LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM) to predict wind power generation based on historical data.

## Contents

- `code/`: Contains the Python scripts for implementing the statistical models and deep learning models, as well as data preprocessing and evaluation.
- `data/`: Contains the datasets used in the analysis:
  - `wind-usa-time-series`: A dataset containing historical wind power production data from the USA.
  - `wind-time-series-dataset-10min`: A dataset with wind power production data recorded at 10-minute intervals.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started

To use or contribute to this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Samaamr/wind-production-forecasting.git
